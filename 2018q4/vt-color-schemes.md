Since 11.2-RELEASE vt(4) supports setting custom color schemes via
the `kern.vt.color.X.rgb` tunables.  This is nice but what was
missing were some ready to use themes.

iTerm2-Color-Schemes is a collection of around 200 color schemes
for various terminals.  It has recently gained support for vt(4).
Customizing your console is now as easy as copy and pasting your
favorite theme to `/boot/loader.conf` or `/boot/loader.conf.local`.
