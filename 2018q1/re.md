The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting
and publishing release schedules for official project releases
of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the
respective branches, among other things.

The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team finalized and announced the release
schedule for 11.2 mid-February, targeted to start mid-April.

Throughout the remainder of the quarter, several development snapshots builds
were released for the *head*, *stable/11*, and *stable/10* branches.

Much of this work was sponsored by the FreeBSD Foundation.
