## AXP803 PMIC driver update ##

Contact: Ganbold Tsagaankhuu, <ganbold@FreeBSD.org>

AXP803 is a highly integrated PMIC that targets Li-battery (Li-ion or Li-polymer)
applications. It provides flexible power management solution for processors such as 
Allwinner A64 SoC which is used by Pinebook (https://www.pine64.org/?page_id=3707)

Following updates were done on AXP803 driver:

  * Enabled necessary bits when activating interrupts. This allows
    reading some events from the interrupt status registers. These events
    are reported to devd via system "PMU" and subsystem "Battery", "AC"
    and "USB" such as plugged/unplugged, battery absent, charged and charging.
  * Added sensors support for AXP803/AXP813. Sensor values such as
    battery charging, charge state, voltage, charging current, discharging current,
    battery capacity can be obtained via sysctl.
  * Added sysctl for setting battery charging current. The charging current 
    can be set using steps from 0: 200mA to 13: 2800mA (200mA/step).
