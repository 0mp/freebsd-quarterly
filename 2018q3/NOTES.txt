#
# These reports are about prior Quarters of activity, the
# contents of most (all?) of the sections should be written in
# the past tense.
#

# Editing:
# Updates should happen to the individual .md files for each
# report section.  This allows for greater editing in parallel,
# with less chance of conflicts.  At the end of the editing process,
# the smaller files will be concatenated together.

# SPECIAL 2018Q3 note: edit the 00_REPORT.md file directly for
# this set of the release notes.

# Each section of the report is written from the point of view
# of different authors, which means that using "we" when describing
# changes / efforts / opinions should be discouraged.
#
# In particular, the section "The FreeBSD Foundation" uses this
# terminology in many, many places.  Too many to edit in a quick
# pass of the documentation.

# Consistency in referenced email addresses:
# Many email addresses referenced in report sections call out the
# email address after a person's name by surround the email address
# with parentheses and including a trailing "at" (@) symbol:
# e.g.  George Neville-Neil (gnn@)
