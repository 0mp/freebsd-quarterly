The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting
and publishing release schedules for official project releases
of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the
respective branches, among other things.

The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team started the 12.0-RELEASE cycle August 10,
beginning with the code slush.  The code slush followed August 24, with the
*stable/12* branch expected to be created September 21.

However, due to unforseen circumstances related to upstream code that was
deemed necessary to include in 12.0-RELEASE, the schedule needed to be
adjusted several times to account for works-in-progress related to the
upstream code to be compatible with other base system utilities.  At the end
of the quarter, the *stable/12* branch had not been created due to this delay.

Throughout the remainder of the quarter, several development snapshots builds
were released for the *head*, *stable/11*, and *stable/10* branches.

Much of this work was sponsored by the FreeBSD Foundation.
