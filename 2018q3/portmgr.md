During the last two quarters, the number of ports grew to just under
34,000.  The number of open PR grew to almost 2,500 with less than 600
of those unassigned. A total of 175 committers made almost 14,200 commits.
Compared to the first quarter, the number of commits dropped by 10% and
the number of PRs grew by 19%.

During the last two quarters, portmgr took five commit bits in for
safekeeping: ian@, nemysis@, daichi@, deichen@, and rea@. We welcomed
John Hixson (jhixson@), Kevin Bowling (kbowling@), Sergey Kozlov
(skozlov@), Fukang Chen (loader@), Gleb Popov (arrowd@),
Mateusz Piotrowski (0mp@), and Jesper Schmitz Mouridsen (jsm@) to the
team. itetcu@ and kevlo@ returned after a hiatus.

During the last two quarters, antoine@ ran 70 exp-runs. Most of them
were for port upgrades, but others include LLD progress, changing the
default port versions, improving support for armv6, armv7, and RISC-V,
removing old base system functionality, new USES,
and better matching pkg-plist with
Makefile options (DOCS and
EXAMPLES).

Three new USES were introduced during the last two quarters:

  * gl replaces the old USE_GL from bsd.port.mk
  * qt-dist, qt:4 and qt:5 replace the old USE_QT from bsd.qt.mk

The default version of PHP was changed from 5.6 to 7.1. The former
version is no longer supported by the developers. Furthermore, the
default versions of Samba and GCC are now respectively 4.7 and 7. The
Xorg ports have been reorganized and there have been changes to
net/openntpd, please read UPDATING if relevant.

Open tasks:
  * The number of commits dropped somewhat over the last two quarters,
    leaving more PRs unresolved. If you can, please pick up some PRs
    and improve everyone's experience.
