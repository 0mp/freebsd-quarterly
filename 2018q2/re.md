The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting
and publishing release schedules for official project releases
of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the
respective branches, among other things.

The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team wrote an initial draft of the FreeBSD
12.0-RELEASE cycle, as well as started the 11.2-RELEASE cycle in April.

The 11.2-RELEASE cycle started April 20 with the code slush, and continued to
progress througout the rest of the quarter with the code freeze, followed by
three BETA builds and three RC builds, with the final release build announced
June 27.

Throughout the remainder of the quarter, several development snapshots builds
were released for the *head*, *stable/11*, and *stable/10* branches.

Much of this work was sponsored by the FreeBSD Foundation.
