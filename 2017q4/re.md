The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting
and publishing release schedules for official project releases
of FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the
respective branches, among other things.

The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team completed the 10.4-RELEASE,
led by Marius Strobl, early October.  FreeBSD 10.4-RELEASE is the
fifth release from the *stable/10* branch, which builds on the
stability and reliability of 10.3-RELEASE

This project was partially sponsered by the FreeBSD Foundation.
